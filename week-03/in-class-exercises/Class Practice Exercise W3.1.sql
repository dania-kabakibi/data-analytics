/* 1- Task: Write a query to list the CategoryID, CategoryName, and Description of every category in
the Northwind database.
Hint: Look at the Categories table. Use SELECT to pick only the columns you need.*/
SELECT CategoryID, CategoryName, Description
FROM categories;

/* 2- Task: Write a query to find all products where the quantity per unit contains the word 'box'
(e.g., '12 boxes' or '24 - 12 oz boxes').
Hint: Use the LIKE operator with wildcard characters to search for partial text matches inside
the QuantityPerUnit column of the Products table.*/
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE QuantityPerUnit LIKE '%box%';

/* 3- Task: Write a query to list all products that are currently discontinued. Display the ProductID,
ProductName, and Discontinued columns.
Hint: The Discontinued column in the Products table stores 1 for discontinued and 0 for active.*/
SELECT ProductID, ProductName, Discontinued
FROM products
WHERE Discontinued = 1;

/* 4- Task: Write a query to display the full name of every employee by combining their first and last
name into a single column. Label the combined column FullName.
Hint: Look at the Employees table. Use string concatenation (+ in SQL Server, || in
SQLite/PostgreSQL) to combine FirstName and LastName with a space between them.*/
SELECT CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', LastName) AS 'FullName'
FROM employees;

/* 5- Task: Write a query to list all customers located in either Germany or France. Display the
CustomerID, CompanyName, and Country.
Hint: You can use IN to test against a list of values instead of writing multiple OR conditions.*/
SELECT CustomerID, CompanyName, Country
FROM customers
WHERE Country IN ('Germany', 'France');

/* 6- Task: How many total orders have been placed in the Orders table? Write a query that returns
this count and labels it TotalOrders.
Hint: Use the COUNT() aggregate function on the primary key of the Orders table.*/
SELECT COUNT(OrderID) AS 'TotalOrders'
FROM orders;

/* 7- Task: Write a query to list all suppliers whose contact title is either 'Sales Representative' or
'Sales Manager'. Show SupplierID, CompanyName, ContactName, and ContactTitle.
Hint: Use the IN operator or two OR conditions in your WHERE clause against the Suppliers
table.*/
SELECT SupplierID, CompanyName, ContactName, ContactTitle
FROM suppliers
WHERE ContactTitle IN ('Sales Representative', 'Sales Manager');

/* 8- Task: Write a query to find all orders that were shipped to the USA. Display OrderID,
CustomerID, ShipCountry, and ShippedDate.
Hint: Filter the Orders table using the ShipCountry column.*/
SELECT OrderID, CustomerID, ShipCountry, ShippedDate
FROM orders
WHERE ShipCountry = 'USA';

/* 9- Task: Examine the Orders table. It records a required date and an actual shipped date. Write a
query to find all orders where the product was shipped after the required date (i.e., the
shipment was late). Display OrderID, CustomerID, RequiredDate, and ShippedDate.
Hint: Compare two date columns using the > operator in a WHERE clause.*/
SELECT OrderID, CustomerID, RequiredDate, ShippedDate
FROM orders
WHERE RequiredDate < ShippedDate;

/* 10- Task: Examine the Products table. It contains a column called UnitsInStock and a column called
ReorderLevel. Write a query that identifies products that need to be reordered — that is,
products where the current stock is at or below the reorder level and the product is NOT
discontinued.
Hint: Combine two conditions in the WHERE clause using AND.*/
SELECT ProductID, ProductName, UnitsInStock, ReorderLevel, Discontinued
FROM products
WHERE  UnitsInStock <= ReorderLevel AND Discontinued = 0;
